# Database Created from a Free Lunch Application Form

In my Database Systems class, my team and I created a conceptual data model and a logical data model based on a school free lunch application form. We then developed a physical database based on the logical data model using MySQL.

This repository contains the original form, both data models, and some example code of the database creation.
